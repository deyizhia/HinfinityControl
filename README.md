# HinfinityControl

## Description

This project is to simulate the Hinfinity Controller for a Single Input Single Output(SISO) feedback system. 
It is used to design the weights so as to compute the resulting controller. The simulink model is developed to graphically show the weights factor and poles, zeros, which can be adjusted by the parameters in m-file.
